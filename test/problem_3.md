Add your answer to problem 3 below.

Please write down at least one paragraph about what you learn from each video

Video 1:

In the video "Trading Psychology: How to Handle FOMO (Dr. Steenbarger)," Dr. Brett Steenbarger explains the common trading emotion of FOMO, 
or Fear Of Missing Out. FOMO is a psychological phenomenon that can affect traders when they feel like they're missing out on potential profits by 
not participating in a particular trade. This fear can lead traders to make impulsive and irrational trading decisions, which can ultimately 
result in losses.

Everything talk about in this video can be used from a perspective of a programmer as well. Overall, the video provides an overview of psychology
and offers practical strategies for managing the emotional challenges of trading that can be applied to programming as well. Dr. Steenbarger's insights are particularly
valuable for new programmers who may be struggling with the emotional ups and downs of the profession, and for experienced programmers who are looking to refine 
their coding strategies and improve their performance. I can take away from this to regularly review their code and analyze their decision-making processes in order to identify 
patterns and areas for improvement.


Video 2:

The video challenges the conventional wisdom that Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an essential part of software development. In summary, the video challenges the 
conventional view that TDD is an essential part of software development, and proposes a more pragmatic approach to testing. Cheney emphasizes the importance of understanding 
the requirements of the program and writing tests that provide value to both the developer and end-users. This approach can be particularly relevant to junior developers who 
are still learning to write high-quality code and may feel overwhelmed by the rigidity of TDD. By focusing on the requirements of the software and writing tests that provide 
value, junior developers can develop a more practical and effective approach to testing that balances the benefits of TDD with the need for speed and efficiency in software development.
